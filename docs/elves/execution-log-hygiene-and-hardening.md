## Staging

- 2026-07-16 13:10 · Staging · Plan authored and verified against repo reality (five external-advice
  claims checked true; work-driver enum drift found: template `devin-cli` vs behavior_policy
  underscore enum without devin). Plan: `docs/plans/hygiene-and-hardening.md`.
- 2026-07-16 13:14 · Staging · Dedicated worktree created via
  `./scripts/preflight.sh --create-worktree elves/hygiene-and-hardening --base origin/main
  --worktree-dir /Users/john/aigora/dev/elves-hygiene-and-hardening`. START_TIP
  `d9862a46fbbcf59759d9b7bb9230494db88d5dec` (collision tripwire).
- 2026-07-16 13:16 · Staging · `.elves-session.json` seeded (run_id, branch, start_head,
  plan_path, worker_packet_path, work_driver, cobbler.default_for_session, continuation_guard);
  `acceptance_contract.py sync-session --write` derived B1–B7 + M-A1..M-A5 rows;
  `validate` → **OK**.
- 2026-07-16 13:18 · Staging · Consolidated coordinator→implementer packet (the prewalk) written to
  `.elves/runtime/worker-packet-hygiene-and-hardening.md` and recorded in session + survival guide.
  This dogfoods B3's packet-at-staging rule before the batch implements it.
- 2026-07-16 13:22 · Staging · Rollback ref `refs/elves/rollback/hygiene-and-hardening-2026-07-16/s1/b0`
  → d9862a46. Staging commit `3eef6b1` pushed; branch tracking origin. PR opened: **#78**
  (https://github.com/aigorahub/elves/pull/78).
- 2026-07-16 13:24 · Staging · Full preflight in worktree: **green**, 3 advisories (survival-guide
  env var, no package manifest — expected for this repo, non-interactive env vars). Survival guide
  validator: first pass flagged missing `## After Any Compaction`; second pass flagged Forbidden
  Stop Reasons wording and the Stop Gate readiness checkbox (the 13:24 commit's "validator green"
  subject was premature — corrected here). Third pass surfaced the full pinned field vocabulary
  (Run Control delegated fields, Cobbler/Stop Gate/Current Phase/Next Exact Batch fields, pinned
  effort and control-loop sentences); guide rewritten fully conformant to the template. Validator
  exit 0 at 13:31. Staging complete → executing.

## Decisions made

- D1 (staging): Worker route = host-native subscription worker sessions (one per batch, per-batch
  packet derived from the consolidated packet). No external providers probed: none configured, the
  native default satisfies the plan, and the user asked for "the worker agent" without a provider
  preference.
- D2 (staging): Version stays 2.6.0 during batches; expect promotion to v2.7.0 at terminal via
  `release_checklist.py` (new user-facing behavior lands in B2/B3/B5).
- D3 (staging): Merge authorization = explicit chat-to-land from the user in-session
  (2026-07-16). Readiness remains independent and is attested at the exact final HEAD.
- D4 (staging): Known-red baseline recorded — `test_cli_gate_failure_exit_code` fails under
  Claude Code env flags; B1 is the fix and must flip the suite to 0 failures.
